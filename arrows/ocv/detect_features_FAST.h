  * A given mask image should be one-channel (mask->depth() == 1). If the
  * given mask image has more than one channel, only the first will be
  * considered.
  * This method overrides the base detect method and adds dynamic threshold
  * adaptation.  It adjusts the detector's feature strength threshold to try
  * and extract a target number of features in each frame. Because scene
  * content varies between images, different feature strength thresholds may
  * be necessary to get the same number of feautres in different images.
  *
  * \param image_data contains the image data to process
  * \param mask Mask image where regions of positive values (boolean true)
  *             indicate regions to consider. Only the first channel will be
  *             considered.
  * \returns a set of image features
