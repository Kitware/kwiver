/// A match_feature algorithm that uses feature position, orientation, and
/// scale constraints

/**
 *  This matching algorithm assumes that the features to be matched are already
 *  somewhat well aligned geometrically.  The use cases are very similar images
 *  (e.g. adjacent frames of video) and features that have been transformed
 *  into approximate alignment by a pre-processing step
 *  (e.g. image registration)
 *
 *  This algorithm first reduces the search space for each feature using a
 *  search radius in the space of location (and optionally orientation and
 *  scale) to find only geometrically nearby features.  It then looks at
 *  the descriptors for the neighbors and finds the best match by appearance.
