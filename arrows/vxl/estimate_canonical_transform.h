/// Algorithm for estimating a canonical transform for cameras and landmarks
/**
 *  A canonical transform is a repeatable transformation that can be recovered
 *  from data.  In this case we assume at most a similarity transformation.
 *  If data sets P1 and P2 are equivalent up to a similarity transformation,
 *  then applying a canonical transform to P1 and separately a
 *  canonical transform to P2 should bring the data into the same coordinates.
 *
 *  This implementation first fits a "ground" plane to the landmark points
 *  using robust estimation methods provided by the rrel library in VXL.
 *  It then estimates the remaining degrees of freedom using PCA much like
 *  the implementation in the core plugin.  The scale is set to normalize the
 *  landmarks to unit standard deviation.
