/// Combines a feature matchers, homography estimation, and filtering
/**
 *  This is a meta-algorithm for feature matching that combines one or more
 *  other feature matchers with homography estimation and feature filtering.
 *  The algorithm applies another configurable feature matcher algorithm and
 *  then applies a homography estimation algorithm to the resulting matches.
 *  Outliers to the fit homography are discarded from the set of matches.
 *
 *  If a second matcher algorithm is provided, this algorithm will warp the
 *  feature locations by the estimated homography before applying the second
 *  matching algorithm to the aligned points.  This approach is useful for
 *  finding weak matches that were missed by the first matcher but are
 *  easier to detect once approximate location is known.  A good choice for
 *  the second matcher is vxl::match_features_constrained.
 *
 *  If a filter_features algorithm is provided, this will be run on the
 *  input features \b before running the first matcher.  The second matcher
 *  will then run on the \b original unfilter features.  This allows, for
 *  example, a slower but more robust feature matcher to run on a subset
 *  of the strongest feature points in order to quickly establish an
 *  and estimated homography.  Then a second, fast matcher can pick up
 *  the additional weak matches using the constraint that the location
 *  in the image is now known approximately.
