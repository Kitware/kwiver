 *  This is a meta-algorithm for feature matching that combines one other feature
 *  matcher with fundamental matrix estimation and feature filtering.
 *  The algorithm applies another configurable feature matcher algorithm and
 *  then applies a fundamental matrix estimation algorithm to the resulting matches.
 *  Outliers to the fit fundamental matrix are discarded from the set of matches.
 *
 *  If a filter_features algorithm is provided, this will be run on the
 *  input features \b before running the matcher.
