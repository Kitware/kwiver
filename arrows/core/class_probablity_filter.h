 * @brief Filters detections based on class probability.
 *
 * This algorithm filters out items that are less than the threshold.
 * The following steps are applied to each input detected object set.
 *
 * 1) Select all class names with scores greater than threshold.
 *
 * 2) Create a new class_map object with all selected class
 *    names from step 1. The class name can be selected individually
 *    or with the keep_all_classes option.
 *
 * 3) The input detection_set is cloned and the class_map
 *    from step 2 is attached.
