/// This algorithm filters out items that are less than the threshold.
/// The following steps are applied to each input detected object set.
///
/// 1) Select all class names with scores greater than threshold.
///
/// 2) Create a new detected_object_type object with all selected class
///    names from step 1. The class name can be selected individually
///    or with the keep_all_classes option.
///
/// 3) The input detection_set is cloned and the detected_object_type
///    from step 2 is attached.
