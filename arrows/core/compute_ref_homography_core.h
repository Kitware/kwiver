 * This class differs from estimate_homographies in that estimate_homographies
 * simply performs a homography regression from matching feature points. This
 * class is designed to generate different types of homographies from input
 * feature tracks, which can transform each image back to the same coordinate
 * space derived from some initial refrerence image.
 *
 * This implementation is state-based and is meant to be run in an online
 * fashion, i.e. run against a track set that has been iteratively updated on
 * successive non-regressing frames. This is ideal for when it is desired to
 * compute reference frames on all frames in a sequence.
