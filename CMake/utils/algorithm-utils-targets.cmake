#
# Variables that affect behavior of functions:
#
#   no_export
#       if set, target will not be exported.
#
#   no_install
#       If set, target will not be installed.
#
#   no_version
#       If set, the target will not have version information added to it.
#
#   component
#     If set, the target will not be installed under this component (the
#     default is 'runtime').
#
#   library_subdir
#     If set, library targets will be placed into the directory with this
#     as a suffix. This is necessary due to the way some systems use
#     CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE as a directory in the output path.
