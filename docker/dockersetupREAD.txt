Kitware 2018 - KWIVER Docker 1.2.0

Purpose:
Build the latest release versions of Fletch/Kwiver inside a docker container on top of Ubuntu:Trusty 14.04, 
 with CMake 3.11.3. 

Script optionally sets up a mounted shared volume between the host and container
in the folder /kwiver/src/docker/SharedKWIVER/KWIVER1.2.0 (host) and in /SharedKWIVER/KWIVER1.2.0 (container)
**enable this in dockersetup.sh

Requirements:
- Script must run in /src/docker/ directory for pathing purposes
- Ensure Docker (tested on version 17.21.1 or higher) is installed on the host that is building KWIVER docker

Process:
Navigate to the directory where the dockerfile is in the KWIVER local repo (src/docker/dockerfile typically) 

If necessary, 
1) modify the dockerfile to build KWIVER/FLETCH with required configuration, otherwise default is used 
2) modify the docketsetup.sh to run KWIVER/FLETCH with required configuration, otherwise default is used

Run the script “dockersetup.sh” this will build, configure, and run KWIVER docker for continued use
