How to build KWIVER with docker:

The provided dockerfile builds from Ubuntu:Trusty 14.04, 
 with CMake 3.11.3, and builds the latest stable release version of Fletch, and Kwiver. 

Script also sets up a mounted shared volume in the folder /src/docker/shared

**Script must run in /src/docker/ directory for pathing purposes

**Ensure you have Docker (tested on version 17.21.1 or higher)
 installed on the host you are trying to run the docker on.

Process:
Navigate to the directory where the dockerfile is in the Kwiver local repo
(source/docker/dockerfile typically) 

If necessary, modify the dockerfile to build Kwiver/Fletch with the cmake options you require; else skip this step, 

Run the script “dockersetup.sh” this will build and configure KWIVER docker for continued use
