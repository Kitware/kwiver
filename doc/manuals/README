In order to generate the files needed for the sphinx server, enter the following command:

$ make html

A local copy of the sphinx server can be started that will serve up the pages created
by the previous command by entering the following command

$ sphinx_server.py

You will need to have Python installed on your system and in a bash or cmd shell that can execute pythong scripts

You will need to install several packages in your python environment
While not strictly required, it is recommended to create a virtual environment these required packages from other python packages. 
To generate a new virtual environment, first install/update the virtualenv and pip packages:

sudo pip install -U virtualenv pip
#sudo is not necessary on windows machines

Now create a virtual environment using the virtualenv command. 
You can place the virtual environment directory wherever you want, but it should not be moved. 
The following command will generate a new directory called kwiver_env in your home directory:

virtualenv ~/kwiver_env
# On windows, it is recommended to create this directory in your user folder with out the ~

Enter the virtual environment:

#Linux
. ~/kwiver_env/bin/activate
#Windows, execute this script in your python cmd window
kwiver_env/bin/Scripts/activate.bat

This call will tell you what environment python is currently in

pip -V


Now install your packages, they will only be assocated with the kwiver_env virtualenv

pip install sphinx
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
pip install livereload
pip install breathe
