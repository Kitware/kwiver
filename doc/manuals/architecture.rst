Architecture
============

The primary design goal of KWIVER is to make it easier to integrate
algorithms and approaches from a wide variety of third-party, open source
image and video processing projects into highly modular, run-time
configurable systems.

This is achieved through the three main components of KWIVER: Vital,
the KWIVER Arrows, and Sprokit.
