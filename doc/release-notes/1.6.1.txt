KWIVER v1.6.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of KWIVER that provides fixes over the previous v1.6.0
release.

Bug Fixes since v1.6.0
----------------------

Arrows: Ceres

 * Fixed a bug in which the FORCE_COMMON_INTRINSICS option in bundle
   adjustment was not actually forcing intrinsics to be common.

Arrows: FFMPEG
 * Fixed a bug in which slight variations in presentation timestamps would
   sometimes cause frames to be skipped while decoding.

 * Fixed a bug in which the video reader would not request any frames at end of
   video that FFmpeg still had buffered internally.

Arrows: MVG

 * Fixed a typo in the command line argument name for camera path in the
   init_cameras_landmarks applet.  This was preventing changing the camera
   directory in the applet.

Arrows: VTK

 * Fixed an error in the calculation of depth used in mesh coloring.  This
   caused coloring to fail to apply color in some cases.  It was primarily
   an issue when the near plane was much closer to the camera than to the
   far plane.

 * Fix an error that always caused a segmentation fault in the
   color_mesh applet for VTK version greater than 9.0.1. The issue was
   that rendering was not properly initialized at build time.

Build System

 * Fix missing `ZeroMQ_INCLUDE_DIR` set when building statically.

 * Fix missing-closing-bracket typo in `CMake/utils/kwiver-utils-python.cmake`.

* Use xvfb in Docker image to support running VTK applets in a headless
   environment.

 * Include CUDA include directories when building CUDA arrow.  This is needed
   if CUDA is not installed in standard system locations.

 * Enable the CUDA arrow in the Docker container.

Vital Algorithms

* Fix potential leak of stream pointers in the base functionality of
  ``write_object_track_set``.

Vital: Logging

 * Fixed an issue in the default logger where leading zeros of fractional
   seconds were being stripped leading to the printing of the incorrect time.
