KWIVER v1.4.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v1.3.0 release.

Updates since v1.3.0
--------------------

Vital

 * Added constructors taking initalizer lists to mesh types for easier
   initialization.
 * Added a new abstract algorithm, uv_unwrap_mesh, which unwraps a mesh and generates normalized texture coordinates.

 * Added iterator, const_iterator and iterable classes to support container-
   independent iteration.

 * Added image_container_set type to contain multiple image_container shared
   pointer instances.

Vital Bindings

Arrows: Core

 * Created a new plugin for core applets

 * Added an applet to render meshes into depth or height maps

 * Added mesh_operations.h, initially with a function to triangulate a mesh.
   That is, subdivide mesh faces into triangles.

 * Added an implementation for triangular mesh unwrapping. The method
   transforms each face independently to 2D and packs them in an
   almost square texture.

Arrows: FFmpeg

Arrows: GDAL

Arrows: OpenCV

Arrows: Serialization

Sprokit

Sprokit: Processes

 * Added an extension plugin capability to embedded_pipeline that
   provides a hook just before the pipeline is set up and a hook after
   pipeline has reached end of data.
