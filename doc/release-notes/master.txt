KWIVER v1.2.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v1.1.0 release.


Updates since v1.1.0
--------------------

Vital

 * C++11 feature test macros have been removed.  The current version of KWIVER
   assumes a fully C++11 compliant compiler; C++11 features should be used
   directly.  VITAL_FOREACH (and the header vital_foreach.h which provided
   this), has also been removed.  Remaining compatibility shims are deprecated
   and should not be used in new code and will eventually be removed also.
   Note also that [[noreturn]] must appear before <lib>_EXPORT; this was not
   the case with the old definition of VITAL_NO_RETURN.

 * Added new data types geo_point and geo_polygon for representing points
   and polygons in geographic coordinates.  These new types use the new
   geodetic conversion function and know how to convert themselves into
   different coordinate systems.  These replace the old geo_UTM, geo_lat_lon
   and geo_corner_points types.

 * The geo_map algorithm has been replaced with a new non-algorithm mechanism
   for geodetic conversion.  The new approach uses member functions on the new
   geodetic types to request conversions in combination with a conversion
   algorithm that must be provided and registered by a suitable plugin (e.g.
   the PROJ.4 arrow).  Registration is automatic when the plugin is loaded,
   with a mechanism in place for users to register their own algorithm if
   desired.  The new API is also more general and supports arbitrary datums,
   not just WGS84.

 * Generalized the track and track_state types to be useful for both feature
   and object tracks.  Data that is specific to features or objects is now
   stored in subclasses of track_state.

 * Generalized the track_set to be useful for both feature and object tracks.
   Added derived classes for feature_track_set and object_track_set to
   indicate the type of tracks in the set and provide specialized helper
   functions.  Algorithm APIs previously using track_set now use either
   feature_track_set or object_track_set.

 * The track_set class now has a separate implementation class named
   track_set_implementation.  Using a bridge design pattern this allows
   any combination of implementations and derived track_set types.  Custom
   track_set implementations allow alternative storage and query mechanisms
   for better scalability and speed under different use cases.

 * The track_set is now a mutable class and has new member functions including
   'insert', 'remove', and 'merge_tracks' to allow in place modification.
   The intent is that most algorithms will now modify a track_set in place
   and return it rather than creating a new track_set from the tracks.  This
   is important for a track_set because it is often a very large structure
   and may now have backend implementations with bookkeeping that we would
   like to persist.

 * Track states now have a pointer (std::weak_ptr) back to the track object
   which contains them.  This means that each track state can belong to at
   most one track, and tracks and track states must now be created and
   referenced only via shared_ptr.  Constructors for track are now protected
   and "make()" static member is used for construction.  A "clone()" function
   is now used for track copy construction.

 * Array descriptors are now iterable (have begin/end methods), allowing them
   to be used in standard algorithms, range-based for, etc.

 * Detected object classifications (detected_object_type) are now iterable
   (have begin/end methods), allowing them to be used in standard algorithms,
   range-based for, etc.  This provides a much more efficient mechanism for
   visiting all classifications.

 * Improved plugin explorer so it is easier to get information ahout
   processes and algorithms. Typicl usage for locating processes would
   be to enter the following command to find which processes have to
   do with reading.

   $ plugin_explorer --proc read

   Then enter the following command when the specific process has been
   identified to get a detailed output about the process.

   $ plugin_explorer --proc image_file_reader -d

 * Added macros to access low level datum objects using port traits.

 * Select operations on detected_object_set now return the selected
   subset as a new detected_object_set.

 * Detected object set is iterable. begin() and end() methods have
   been added in place of returning the vector of detections. This
   allows iteration over arbitrarily large detection sets. Also
   simplifies the select methods that now return a detected_object_set
   rather than a vector of detections.

 * Added method to return a vector of values from a single config
   entry. The method is templated on the vector element type.

 * Added at() method to detected_object_set to provide bounds checked
   direct indexing.

 * Added process properties that are bound to the process
   object. Process properties were created based on the process class
   hierarchy, where the derived process would create the set of
   properties. There are cases where the derived process does not know
   all the properties, such as when process instrumentation is
   enabled. The solution is to add a set of properties that is part of
   the process object that can accumulate these condition based
   properties. Properties from the derived class are merged with the
   fixed set of properties when the set of properties is requested.

Vital Bindings

 * Vital C and Python bindings have been updated with respect the refactoring
   of tracks and track_sets to account for both feature and object tracks.

Arrows: Core

 * Added a new frame-indexed track_set_implementation.  When used in place of
   the default track_set_implementation this implemenation will cache a mapping
   from frame number to the set of track states on that frame.  This makes it
   substantially faster to query tracks by frame ID.

 * Modified feature tracking and loop closure algorithms to modify the
   track_set object in place and return the same object.

 * Renamed merge_tracks.h to match_tracks.h and removed all track merging
   functions.  Track merging is now a function of the track_set itself.

 * Removed description() methods from some implementations. This
   method is no longer used.

Sprokit

 * Removed the CMake function sprokit_add_plugin and replaced it with the more
   general kwiver_add_plugin function that is used elsewhere in KWIVER.

 * Process instrumentation calls have been added to all
   processes. Process instrumentation provides the ability to monitor
   the activity of processes on a per-process basis. It can be used to
   trace process execution when debugging a pipeline hang or to
   collect performance data. These instrumentation calls are handled
   by an instrumentation provider selected at runtime on a per process
   basis with the default implementation doing nothing. The following
   is an example for how to specify a instrumentation handler.

   process my_process :: process_type
     block _instrumentation
       type = logger    # select logger implementation
       block  logger
          # add config items for specific implementaion
          # currently the logger has no additional configuration
       endblock
     endblock

   The list of available implementations can be determined using the
   following command:

     $plugin_explorer --fact instrumentation

 * Added test to threaded scheduler to detect when a python process is
   in the pipeline. If a python process is found, an exception is
   thrown.

Unit Tests

 * KWIVER is in the process of transitioning to Google Test as its primary
   testing framework.  This means that Google Test is now a hard dependency
   when KWIVER_ENABLE_TESTS is ON.  (Recent versions of Fletch include Google
   Test.)  The Sprokit tests will continue to use their own framework.


Fixes since v1.1.0
------------------

Sprokit

 * Top level pipeline descriptions that are sourced from a stream do
   not have a file name to use when relativepath config entries are
   specified. The fix is to add an optional parameter supplying the
   directory and file name that represent the location of the pipeline
   definition and can be used to supply needed directory for
   relativepath.
