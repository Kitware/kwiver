KWIVER v1.9.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v1.8.0 release.

Updates
-------

Arrows: Core

* Implemented the csv_reader reading std::optional fields.

* Made the transcode applet's failure to open a video result in a more graceful exit.

* Made the transcode applet ask for video settings slightly later, when they
  might be more accurate.

Arrows: FFmpeg

* Added check for incoming raw video packets' timestamps and stream indices.

* Added functionality to copy the input video's start timestamp when transcoding.

* Removed imagery_enabled option from ffmpeg_video_input.

Arrows: KLV

* Ensured that NaN comparisons happen consistently across all data structures.

* Throw an exception when reading an out-of-bounds IMAP value.

* Made the compare-klv applet's failure to open a video result in a more graceful exit.

* Disabled initialization of image writer in dump-klv if no images are to be written.

* Accounted for missing or extra frames in compare-klv.

* Implemented metadata_map_io_csv.load_().

* Modified flint/IMAP behavior to print a warning when writing values with
  incorrect lengths instead of correcting the length and possibly losing data.
