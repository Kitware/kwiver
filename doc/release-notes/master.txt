===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and
fixes over the previous v1.2.0 release.


Updates since v1.2.0
--------------------

Vital


Vital Bindings


Arrows: Core


Arrows: FFmpeg

 * Created a new FFmpeg arrow with a video_input algorithm implementation.
   This provides an alternative to the vidl_ffmpeg_video_input in the VXL
   arrow.  The goal is to provide direct access to FFMPEG without requiring
   VXL and to improve efficency, especially with video seeking.  Currently
   this implementation is not full featured and does not yet provide a
   complete replacement for the VXL implementation.

Arrows: GDAL

 * Created a new GDAL arrow with an image_io algorithm implementation.
   This allows opening images with GDAL, which is especially useful for
   Geospatial image formats like GeoTIFF and NITF.

Arrows: OpenCV


Arrows: VXL
