KWIVER v1.5.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v1.4.0 release.

Updates since v1.4.0
--------------------

Vital

 * Added a parameter to the clone() methods of the track_state, track and
   track_set types controlling whether to make an actual deep copy (default) or
   to make a shallow copy (previous behavior) where elements of the derived
   feature_track_state or object_track_state would still be shared. (This
   change also affects track_set::merge_in_other_track_set(). However, the copy
   constructors of feature_track_state and object_track_state still make only
   shallow copies.)

 * Added a variant of config_block::get_enum_value that accepts a default
   value to fall back on.
