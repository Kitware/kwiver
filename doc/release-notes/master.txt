 * Added functions to camera_intrinsics to test if a point is in the valid
   domain of the mapping function.  In the radial distortion case of
   simple_camera_intrinsics, this computes a maximum radius for which
   distortion is valid.  This feature is to help avoid invalid projections
   of points into images due to the distortion being non-injective.
