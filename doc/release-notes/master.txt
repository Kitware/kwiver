KWIVER v1.9.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of KWIVER that provides both new functionality and fixes
over the previous v1.8.0 release.

Updates
-------

Vital: Types

* Added interfaces for copying uninterpreted video data.

Arrows: Core

* Implemented the csv_reader reading std::optional fields.

* Increased the precision of written floats and doubles in the csv_writer.

* Made the transcode applet's failure to open a video result in a more graceful exit.

* Made the transcode applet ask for video settings slightly later, when they
  might be more accurate.

* Added pass-throughs for uninterpreted video data in the metadata_filter and
  buffered_metadata_filter video inputs.

* Cleaned up dump-klv's printed output.

Arrows: FFmpeg

* Added check for incoming raw video packets' timestamps and stream indices.

* Added functionality to copy the input video's start timestamp when transcoding.

* Removed imagery_enabled option from ffmpeg_video_input.

* Added proper handling for changing size or pixel format mid-video.

* Improved probing behavior and increased duration.

* Ensured proper clearing of video state even when seek attempts fail.

* Exposed codec options in ffmpeg_video_settings.

* Optimized copying behavior when encoding frames.

* Implemented packet lookahead to ensure stream synchronization.

* Implemented copy of audio streams from input to output.

* Fixed bugs causing invalid output when transcoding between .mp4 and .ts files.

* Made the MPEG-TS stream id take precedence when determining KLV stream synchronicity.

* Added video_input_ffmpeg_rewire.

Arrows: KLV

* Ensured that NaN comparisons happen consistently across all data structures.

* Throw an exception when reading an out-of-bounds IMAP value.

* Made the compare-klv applet's failure to open a video result in a more graceful exit.

* Disabled initialization of image writer in dump-klv if no images are to be written.

* Accounted for missing or extra frames in compare-klv.

* Implemented metadata_map_io_csv.load_().

* Modified flint, IMAP, and integer behavior to print a warning when writing
  values with incorrect lengths instead of correcting the length and possibly
  losing data.

* Ensured integer wrapper data formats (enum, enum bitfield) use the same
  lenient length logic as integers to prevent crashes when writing invalid data.

* Added has_nanoseconds to misp_timestamp.

* Added frame_timestamp() to klv_metadata.

* Added tag 143 (Metadata Substream ID) to ST0601.

* Implement remaining obscure IMAP features.
