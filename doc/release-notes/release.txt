KWIVER v1.6.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of KWIVER that provides fixes over the previous
v1.6.0 release.

Bug Fixes since v1.6.0
----------------------

Arrows: MVG

 * Fixed a typo in the command line argument name for camera path in the
   init_cameras_landmarks applet.  This was preventing changing the camera
   directory in the applet.

Arrows: VTK

 * Fixed an error in the calculation of depth used in mesh coloring.  This
   caused coloring to fail to apply color in some cases.  It was primarily
   an issue when the near plane was much closer to the camera than to the
   far plane.

Build System

 * Fix missing `ZeroMQ_INCLUDE_DIR` set when building statically.

 * Fix missing-closing-bracket typo in `CMake/utils/kwiver-utils-python.cmake`.

 * Use xvfb in Docker image to support running VTK applets in a headless environment.

 * Include CUDA include directories when building CUDA arrow.  This is needed
   if CUDA is not installed in standard system locations.

 * Enable the CUDA arrow in the Docker container.
