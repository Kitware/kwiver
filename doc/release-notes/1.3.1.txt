Bug Fixes since v1.3.0
----------------------

 * Fixed issue where ffmpeg_video_input does not set the depth step for
   frame images correctly.

 * Fixed an issue in the MSVC environment in which and extra ";" was
   appended to each variable

 * Fixed an issue in the MSVC environment in which redefining variables
   from setup_KWIVER.bat would append to the old value instead of replacing.

 * Added missing GDAL_DATA and PROJ_LIB environment variables in setup_KWIVER
   scripts.  These must be set to do any coordinate conversions with GDAL or
   PROJ.

   missing from the installation scripts.
