KWIVER v1.5.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of KWIVER that provides fixes over the previous
v1.5.0 release.

Bug Fixes since v1.5.0
----------------------

Config

 * Add support for Visual Studio 2019 in the setup_KWIVER.bat

Vital

 * Added a missing include file in track.cxx required to build on MSVC 2019.

 * Changed incorrect metadata tag in convert_0601_metadata.cxx from
   KLV_0601_TARGET_LOCATION_LAT to KLV_0601_TARGET_LOCATION_ELEV.

 * Fixed a typo in the TARGET_LOCATION metadata field name.

 * Updated metadata field names for kv::geo_point types to be more
   descriptive. Made the distinction between elevation and altitude.

Arrows: Ceres

 * Fixed a bug in which the update_state_every_iteration config option
   for bundle_adjust was not respected and was always manually overridden with
   "true" if a callback was registered.

Arrows: Core

 * Remove some unnecessary computation in initialize_camera_landmarks_keyframe
   by adding checks to detect earlier when computations that cannot achieve
   their desired result due to insufficient data.

 * Fixed a bug in initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe in which the
   principal point was not initialized from the image size unless there
   was also metadata useful for determining focal length.  Distortion
   parameters were also not properly preserved in this initialization
   and this has also been resolved.

 * Fixed a bug in initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe in which the
   camera estimation loop would sometimes exit early without processing
   the remaining cameras.  This is further improved to try the lists of
   remaining cameras multiple times until no further cameras are added.

 * Fixed a bug in initialize_cameras_landmarks_keyframe in which the
   updated landmarks are not returned from a helper function and therefore
   intermediate results are returned as the final output.

 * Fixed a bug in track features that was causing a crash on Linux after
   detecting features on the first frame of video.

Arrows: CUDA

 * Fixed a linking error on Linux with some versions of CUDA requiring
   to "recompile with -fPIC".

 * Fixed a bug in launching the integrate_depth_maps CUDA kernel.
   Previously, the kernel would fail to launch if the size of the volume
   along the X direction was greater than 1024.

 * Added a max_voxels_per_launch configuration option to the CUDA
   integrate_depth_maps algorithm.  This works around a CUDA limitation
   in which long-running CUDA kernels cause the GPU to freeze the system.
   On Windows this leads to a time out after 2 seconds and the application
   is terminated.  To avoid this we now launch the kernel multiple times
   covering a subset of voxels in each chunk.

Arrows: OpenCV

 * Fixed improper use of RANSAC in the OpenCV estimate_pnp algorithm.
   This algorithm was producing a lower then expected success rate when
   resectioning cameras.

 * Fixed a long standing bug with memory management when converting between
   OpenCV and Vital images.  Reference counting was not handled correctly.
   A workaround was previously added that forced a deep copy, but this created
   another bug resulting in images with invalid first_pixel() values.
   Both of these issues have been addressed.

Arrows: Serialize

 * Fixed a bug in the JSON serializer for metadata where bool fields caused a
   runtime error.

 * Fixed a bug in JSON serialization of metadata maps which caused name
   collisions for multiple metadata packets associated the same frame. This
   made the output unusable by applications other than KWIVER.
