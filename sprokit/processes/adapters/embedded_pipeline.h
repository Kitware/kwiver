/**
 * @brief Embedded callable pipeline.
 *
 * This class implements a sprokit pipeline that can be instantiated
 * within a program.
 *
 * Inputs to the pipeline are passed to the input adapter through the
 * send() method. Outputs from the pipeline are retrieved using the
 * receive() method.
 *
 * The pipeline description must contain only one input adapter
 * (process type "input_adapter") and only one output adapter (process
 * type "output_adapter"). The actual process names are up to you.
 * The pipeline should be configured so that the inputs to the
 * pipeline come from the input_adapter and the outputs go to the
 * output_adapter. There are no other constraints on the pipeline
 * topology.
 *
 * When creating a data set for the input adapter, there must be a
 * datum for each port on the input_adapter_process. The process will
 * throw an exception if there is a datum for a port that is not
 * connected or there is a port that does not have a datum in the set.
 *
 * Example:
\code
  #include <sprokit/pipeline_util/literal_pipeline.h>

  // SPROKIT macros can be used to create pipeline description
  std::stringstream pipeline_desc;
  pipeline_desc << SPROKIT_PROCESS( "input_adapter",  "ia" )
                << SPROKIT_PROCESS( "output_adapter", "oa" )

                << SPROKIT_CONNECT( "ia", "counter",  "oa", "out_num" )
                << SPROKIT_CONNECT( "ia", "port2",    "oa", "port3" )
                << SPROKIT_CONNECT( "ia", "port3",    "oa", "port2" )
    ;

  // create embedded pipeline
  kwiver::embedded_pipeline ep;
  ep.build_pipeline( pipeline_desc );

  // Query adapters for ports
  auto input_list = ep.input_port_names();
  auto output_list = ep.output_port_names();

  // Verify ports are as expected. (if needed)
  // This is more likely needed if the pipeline description is read from
  // an external file where external forces can affect the validity of
  // the pipeline description.
  // ...

  // Start pipeline
  ep.start();

  for ( int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  {
    // Create dataset for input
    auto ds = kwiver::adapter::adapter_data_set::create();

    // Add value to be pushed to the named port
    ds.add_value( "counter", i );

    // Data values need to be supplied to all connected ports
    // (based on the previous pipeline definition)
    ds.add_value( "port2", i );
    ds.add_value( "port3", i );
    ep.send( ds ); // push into pipeline

    // Get output from pipeline
    auto rds = ep.receive();

    // get value from the output adapter
    int val = get_port_data<int>( "out_num" );

    // val should be the same as i

  } // end for

  ep.send_end_of_input(); // indicate end of input

  auto rds = ep.receive(); // Retrieve end of input data item.
  if ( ! ep.at_end() || ! rds.is_end_of_data() )
  {
    // This is unexpected.
