/**
 * @brief Image object classifier process.
 *
 * This process is intended to be used after an initial object detection step
 * identifies potentially interesting regions within an image, defined by a
 * detected_object_set, to run a subsequent, potentially more
 * expensive, detector/classifier algorithm. Each bounding box from the input
 * detected_object_set defines a sub-image, which is passed to the specified
 * detection algorithm. The result is a new, presumably more accurate,
 * detected_object_set, which may not have direct correlation with the input set
 * of image_object_detection other than being contained within the union of its
 * bounding boxes.
