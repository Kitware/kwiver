  // Note that the use of _sptr in objet typing.
  // All vital objects (types, algorithms, etc.) provide a shared_pointer typedef
  // This shared pointer typedef is used through out kwiver to elimate the need of memory ownership managers

  // All algorithms are implemented/encapsulated in an arrow, and operate on vital classes
  // There are various algorithms (arrows) that kwiver provides that you can use to analyze imagry
  // In this example, while we will look at a few algorithms, this example highlights the vital data types used by algorithms
  // These vital data types can then be used as inputs or outputs for algorithms.
  // The vital data types are a sort of common 'glue' between dispart algorithms allowing them to work together.

  // Image I/O algorithms are derived from the kwiver::vital::image_io algorithm interface

  // While we could instantiate a particular algorithm object directly with this code
  // kwiver::arrows::ocv::image_io ocv_io;
  // kwiver::arrows::vxl::image_io vxl_io;
  // This would require our application to include specific headers be include in our code
  // and require our application to directly link to OpenCV and cause a dependency

  // A key feature of the KWIVER architecture is the ability to dynamically load available algorithms at runtime.
  // This ability allow you to write your application with a set of basic data types and algorithm interfaces and
  // then dynamically replace or reconfigure algorithms at run time without needing to recompile
  // New algorithms can be dropped on disk at and KWIVER can run them
