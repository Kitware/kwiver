// https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/issues/1049#issuecomment-326688270
// Subclasses will still be able to override it, however.
// Pybind automatically downcasts pointers returned by clone and inverse_ to the lowest possible
// subtype, but under certain circumstances, the returned pointer can get sliced.
// The above link has a solution to this issue. The trampoline's implementation of
// clone and inverse_ also was modified to follow this pattern

// NOTE: Since inverse was public, it will need to be defined in any subclass' binding code,
// assuming that the subclass implements inverse_. Homography implements its own inverse() that
// has a different return type, which is adequate.
