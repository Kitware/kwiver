/**
 * @brief Detected object type classification.
 *
 * This class represents a set of possible types for the detected
 * object. A type for an object is represented by a class_name string
 * and a score.
 *
 * When an object is classified, there may be several possibilities
 * determined, since the classification process is probabilistic. This
 * class captures the set of possible types along with the relative
 * likelyhood or score.
 *
 * Note that score values in this object are *not* constrained to
 * [0.0,1.0] because different detectors use different approaches for
 * scores. These scores can be normalized, but that is up to the user
 * of these values.
 *
 * Note that the list of possible names is managed through a class
 * static string pool. Every effort has been made to make this pool
 * externally unmutable. Your cooperation is appreciated.
