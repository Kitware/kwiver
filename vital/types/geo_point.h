/** Geo-coordinate.

 * This class represents a geolocated point. The point is created by specifying
 * a raw location and a CRS. The original location and original CRS may be
 * directly accessed, or the location in a specific CRS may be requested.
 * Requests for a specific CRS are cached, so that CRS conversion does not need
 * to be performed every time.
 *
 * The CRS values shall correspond to geodetic CRS's as specified by the
 * European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG) Spatial Reference System Identifiers
 * (SRID's). Some well known values are defined by kwiver::vital::SRID.
 *
 * Note that the underlying values are ordered easting, northing, for
 * consistency with Euclidean convention (X, Y), and \em not northing, easting
 * as is sometimes used for geo-coordinates.
