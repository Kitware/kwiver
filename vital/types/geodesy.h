/**
 * \brief Determine UTM/UPS zone of lat/lon geo-coordinate.
 *
 * This determines the appropriate greater UTM or UPS zone given an input
 * coordinate in a latitude/longitude coordinate system. "Greater zone" here
 * means that UTM zones are distinguished only by north/south; the irregular
 * grid zones in northern Europe are not considered.
 *
 * The resulting zone will be appropriate for the input datum; for example,
 * input in NAD83 lat/lon will produce a result suitable for representing in
 * NAD83 UTM. The user is responsible for ensuring that the input coordinate is
 * in a lat/lon system.
 *
 * Note that the coordinate values are assumed to be in degrees (not radians),
 * in the order easting (longitude), northing (latitude), for consistency with
 * geo_point. Out of range longitude values are normalized.
 *
 * \returns The UTM/UPS zone information.
 * \throws std::range_error
 *   Thrown if the latitude (northing) value is outside of the range
 *   <code>[-90, 90]</code>.
