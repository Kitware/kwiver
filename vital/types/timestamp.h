 * \brief Frame time.
 *
 * This class represents a timestamp for a single video frame.  The
 * time is stored in micro-seconds and frame numbers start at one.
 *
 * A timestamp has the notion of valid time and valid frame. This is
 * useful when dealing with interpolated timestamps. In this case, a
 * timestamp may have a time, but no frame.
 *
 * When comparing timestamps, they must be from the same domain. If
 * not, then they are not comparable and \b all relative operators
 * return false.
 *
 * If both timestamps have a time, then they are ordered by that
 * value.  If both do not have time but both have frame numbers, they
 * are ordered by frame number. If the timestamps do not have some way
 * of being compared, all relational operators return false.
