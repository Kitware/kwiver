/**
 * The primary use case for this class is to aid bookkeeping for track merging.
 * When you merge one track into another and transfer all of its states it
 * leaves behind an invalid track with no states.  A track may appear in
 * multiple matches and merging one match may invalidate another match if one
 * of the tracks is invalidated.  This class allows the merging function
 * to insert a redirect into an invalidated track such that later matches
 * can find the new version of the track.
 *
 * Example: assume a matcher returns matches (A,B) and (B,C).  The merge
 * function merges B into A producing a longer A and an empty B.  B uses this
 * class to redirect to A.  The merge function tries to merge C into B, but B
 * is now invalid.  However, B redirects to A, so the function tries to merge
 * C into A instead.

 * Frame ids are in monotonically increasing order but need not be sequential.
 * The same track structure can be used to represent feature tracks for
