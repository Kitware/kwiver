/// The representation of an in-memory image.
/**
 * This base image class represents an image with a dynamic data type.  The
 * underlying data type can be queried using pixel_traits().  To properly
 * access individual pixels the data type must be known.  The templated at<T>()
 * member function provides direct access to pixels.  Alternatively, cast the
 * image itself into an image_of object.  The typed image_of class is a bit
 * easier to work with once the type is known, but this base class is useful
 * in APIs that may operate on images of various types.
 *
 * Memory Management
 * -----------------
 *
 * This image class supports two modes of memory management.  Either the image
 * owns its memory or it does not.  If the image owns its memory the
 * image::memory() function will return a shared pointer to that image_memory
 * object.  Otherwise, image::memory() will return nullptr.  In both cases,
 * image::first_pixel() returns a pointer to the first pixel of the memory
 * that appears in the image.  The address of the first pixel does not need
 * to match the starting address of the image_memory.  There can be multiple
 * different views into the same memory (e.g. a cropped image view) and these
 * views may use the same memory object with a different offsets to the first
 * pixel, size, and step parameters.
 *
 * Typically the image manages its own memory in a reference counted
 * image_memory object.  Creating a new image will allocate this memory, which
 * can be accessed from image::memory().  Copying an image will make a shallow
 * copy refering to the same memory object, and the memory will be deleted
 * when all images are done with it.
 *
 * There is a special constructor that allows construction of an image as a
 * veiw into some existing memory.  In this case the image does not own the
 * memory and image::memory() will return nullptr.  The user must ensure that
 * the memory exists for the lifetime of the image.

 * This class is derived from the image() class to provide convenience
 * functions that require the pixel type to be known at compile time.
 * This derived class does not add any data or change any behavior of the
 * base image() class.  It simply provides a strongly-typed view of the data.
 * The constructors in this class make it easier to construct an image.
 * For example,
\code
image I;
// direct construction of a double image
I = image(100, 100, 1, false, pixel_traits_of<double>());
// equivalent construction using image_of
I = image_of<double>(100, 100);
\endcode
 *
 * Once cast as an image_of() the operator()() is available to directly access
 * pixels with a simpler syntax. For example
\code
image_of<float> my_img(100, 100);     // make a float image of size 100 x 100
float val = my_img(10, 10);           // get pixel at 10, 10
      val = my_img.at<float>(10, 10); // image::at method does the same thing
\endcode
 *
 * An image() can be directly assigned to an image_of() object and this will
 * throw a image_type_mismatch_exception if the underlying type does not match.
 * For example
\code
// make a 16-bit unsigned image with the base class
image my_img(100, 100, 1, false, pixel_traits_of<uint16_t>());

image_of<uint16_t> my_img16 = my_img; // this works
image_of<float> my_imgf = my_img;     // this throws an exception
