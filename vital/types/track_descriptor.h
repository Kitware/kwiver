 *
 * A raw descriptor typically represents some measurements taken
 * either from image contents (such as a BoW model over some region, a
 * HoG descriptor, a CNN layer, some shape model...) or other source.
 *
 * It could have been computed using time-series image data, from data
 * from just tracks, 2D image data, or something else. Descriptors are
 * typically used as an intermediate form before storing or as input
 * for classification for higher level recognition tasks.
 *
 * Note that object of this class are created using factory methods.
