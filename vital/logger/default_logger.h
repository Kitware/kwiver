/**
 * @brief Factory for default underlying logger.
 *
 * This class represents the factory for the default logging service.
 *
 * This is a minimal implementation of a kwiver logger. The logging
 * level is set to a default threshold depending on the build mode. If
 * built in debug mode, the threshold is set to display TRACE level
 * messages and above, which is all lob messages. If built in release
 * mode, the threshold is set to display WARN level messages and
 * above, which results in a much reduced logger output.
 *
 * The default log threshold can be overridden by an environment
 * variable "KWIVER_DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL". If this is set to a
 * recognizable level, the default will be set to that level. If the
 * level is not recognized, the default level is unchanged and no
 * error message is generated.
 *
 * Recognized levels are: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal.
