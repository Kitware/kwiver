   * @brief Add plugin_factory instance to this loader.
   *
   * This method adds the specified plugin factory instance to the plugin
   * manager. This method is usually called from the plugin
   * registration function in the loadable module to self-register all
   * plugins in a module.
   *
   * Factory instances provide *MUST* have the following attributes set
   * - INTERFACE_TYPE
   * - CONCRETE_TYPE
   * - PLUGIN_NAME
   *
   * Plugin factory objects are grouped under the interface type name,
   * so all factories that create the same interface are together.
   *
   * By adding a factory, we set the PLUGIN_FILE_NAME attribute to be the name
   * of library module it was added from.
   *
   * A factory may fail to be added if:
   *   * It already exists in this loader based on the combo of INTERFACE_TYPE,
   *     CONCRETE_TYPE and PLUGIN_NAME attributes.

   *
   * @return A pointer is returned to the added factory. This may be used to set
   * additional attributes to the factory.
   *
   * @throws plugin_already_exists
   * If the factory being added looks to already have been added before.
   *
   * Example:
   \code
   void add_factories( plugin_loader* pm )
   {
     plugin_factory_handle_t fact = pm->add_factory( new foo_factory() );
     fact->add_attribute( "file-type", "xml mit" );

   * concrete type in relation to the interface type.
   * The factory created from this will check that the given interface descends
   * from \ref pluggable and that the concrete class descends from the interface
   * class.
   *
   * Plugin factory objects are grouped under an identifier of the interface
   * type so all factories that create implementations of the same interface are
   * grouped together.
   *
   * Factories are created with the PLUGIN_FILE_NAME attribute set to be the
   * name of library module it was added from.
   *
   * A factory may fail to be added if:
   *   * It already exists in this loader based on the combo of INTERFACE_TYPE,

   * This method is the primary method plugin module registration functions
   * self-register all plugins in a module.
