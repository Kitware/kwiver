 * occurs a new string (char*) is allocated for ``message`` and the error_code
 * is set to a non-zero value.
 *
 * If ``message`` is already allocated then the previous memory is first freed.
 *
 * A single error handle can be reused between multiple API calls, but one
 * should check the status between calls and copy the message string before
 * reusing the error handle to avoid losing the message.
