/// \brief Config file parser.
///
/// This class converts config file contents into a single config
/// block.  The intent is that this parser creates one config block
/// from desired inputs.  Delete the object when done. Allocate another
/// if another config block is needed.
///
/// Files specified on the include directive are found by scanning the
/// search path. If they are not found on that path then the directory
/// of the config file that contains the include directive is checked.
///
/// The file passed to the parse_config() directory are taken as is and
/// not searched for in the path. This file should have already been
/// located by the calling logic.
///
/// Example code:
/// \code
/// std::auto< kwiver::vital::config_parser> input_config( new kwiver::vital::config_parser() );
/// input_config->add_search_path( "../config" );
/// input_config->parse_config( filename );
/// // Optionally, additional files can be parsed into the same config block.
/// kwiver::vital::config_block_sptr blk = input_config->get_config();
/// \endcode
