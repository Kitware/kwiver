/// Config difference class for validating provided config.
/**
 * This class performs differencing between a reference set of config
 * entries, such as your expected config block, and a config block
 * that is passed to the class. These two config blocks are diff'd two
 * ways to get the list of expected config entries that are not
 * supplied and the list of config entries that are supplied but not
 * requested.
 *
 * It is up to the user to determine what these two lists mean and how
 * to report the differences.
 *
 * There are a few cases, such as processes and algorithms, where the
 * expected config is known and established in the code. In these
 * cases it is useful to know if there are any extra config items
 * supplied that are not expected. Must usually these extra items are
 * misspellings of expected ones, or from general confusion about what
 * config entries are really required.
 *
 * The following example shows how the config difference might be used
 * to detect config errors.
 *
 \code
  //                                    ref-config                received-config
