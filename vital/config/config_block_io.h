 * true (default value), then the remaining directories in the search
 * path are checked to see if additional versions of the file can be
 * found. If so, then the contents are merged, with values in files earlier in
 * the search order taking precedence, into the resulting config block. If the
 * \c merge parameter is \b false. then reading process stops after the first
 * file is found.
 *
 * A platform specific search path is constructed as follows:

 * - <install-dir>/config
 *
 * The environment variable \c KWIVER_CONFIG_PATH can be set with a
 * list of one or more directories, in the same manner as the native
 * execution \c PATH variable, to be searched for config files.
