 *  implementation is using a parent definition that is NOT the base definition,
 *  the base must also be provided as the third template argument. It also
 *  follows that the Parent algorithm_def type provided must descend from the
 *  BaseDef algorithm_def type provided. IF this is not the case, some compilers
 *  may error if this is the case (e.g. GCC will fail with an "invalid covariant
 *  return type" due to the algorithm_impl's clone method).
