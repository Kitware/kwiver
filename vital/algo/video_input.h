/// An abstract base class for reading videos
/**
 * This class represents an abstract interface for reading
 * videos. Once the video is opened, the frames are returned in order.
 *
 * Use cases:
 * ----------
 *
 * 1) Reading video from a directory of images.
 *
 * 2) Reading video frames from a list of file names.
 *
 * 3) Reading video from mpeg/video file (one of many formats) (e.g. FMV)
 *
 * 4) Reading video from mpeg/video file (one of many formats) with
 *    cropping (e.g. WAMI). This includes Providing geostationary
 *    images by cropping to a specific region from an image. This may
 *    result in no data if the geo region and image do not intersect.
 *
 * 5) Reading video from network stream. (RTSP) This may result in
 *    unexpected end of video conditions and network related
 *    disruptions (e.g. missing frames, connection terminating, ...)
 *
 * A note about the basic capabilities:
 *
 * HAS_EOV - This capability is set to true if the video source can
 *     determine end of video. This is usually the case if the video
 *     is being read from a file, but may not be known if the video is
 *     coming from a streaming source.
 *
 * HAS_FRAME_NUMBERS - This capability is set to true if the video source
 *     supplies frame numbers. If the video source specifies a frame
 *     number, then that number is used when forming a time stamp. If
 *     the video does not supply a frame number, the time stamp will
 *     not have a frame number.
 *
 * HAS_FRAME_TIME - This capability is set to true if the video source
 *     supplies a frame time. If a frame time is supplied, it is made
 *     available in the time stamp for that frame. If the frame time
 *     is not supplied, then the timestamp will not have the time set.
 *
 * HAS_FRAME_DATA - This capability is set to true if the video source
 *     supplies frame images. It may seem strange for a video input
 *     algorithm to not supply image data, but happens with a reader
 *     that only supplies the metadata.
 *
 * HAS_ABSOLUTE_FRAME_TIME - This capability is set to true if the
 *     video source supplies an absolute, rather than relative frame
 *     time. This capability is not set if an absolute frame time can
 *     not be found, or if the absolute frame time is configured as
 *     "none".
 *
 * HAS_METADATA - This capability is set if the video source supplies
 *     some type of metadata. The metadata could be in 0601 or 0104 data
 *     formats or a different source.
 *
 * HAS_TIMEOUT - This capability is set if the implementation supports the
 *     timeout parameter on the next_frame() method.
 *
 * IS_SEEKABLE - This capability is set if the video source can seek to a
 *      specific frame.
 *
 * All implementations \b must support the basic traits, in that they
 * are registered with a \b true or \b false value. Additional
 * implementation specific (extended) traits may be added. The
 * application should first check to see if a extended trait is
 * registered by calling has_trait() since the actual implementation
 * is set by a configuration entry and not directly known by the
 * application.
 *
 * Extended capabilities can be created to publish capabilities of
 * non-standard video sources. These capabilities should be namespaced using
 * the name (or abbreviation) of the concrete algorithm followed by
 * the abbreviation of the capability.
