/// An abstract base class serializing and deserializing.
/**
 * This class represents a pair of methods that serialize and
 * deserialize concrete data types. These methods are guaranteed to
 * work together. A data type serialized and deserialized by this
 * algorithm are semantically equivalent. The format and process of
 * actually doing the serialization depends on the concrete
 * implementation.
 *
 * This interface allows an implementation to serialize one or more
 * data items into a single transport message byte string by accepting
 * and producing a map of data items indexed by the set of names known
 * to the implementation. It is expected that the element names will
 * reflect the semantic data type.
 *
 * It is expected that implementations of this interface will not
 * require any implementation specific configuration parameters. This
 * is because the implementation is selected at run time based on the
 * data type of the port connections.
 *
 * The serializer is stateless and idempotent.
 *
 * The main application for this algorithm is to serialize data
 * objects for inter-process communications.
