/**
 * \brief Encapsulation class for an event signal.
 *
 * This class represents a signal which may be emitted when an event occurs.
 * Signals provide a mechanism by which interested listeners may connect to
 * the signal in order to receive notification of the event. Because connected
 * slots are executed synchronously, it is generally recommended such slots
 * execute as quickly as possible.
 *
 * The thread on which connected slots will be invoked is specified by the
 * logic which emits the signal, and in general should be considered as
 * unspecified. The order in which connected slots are executed is also
 * unspecified and may change between program executions or when the set of
 * connected slots changes.
 *
 * Concurrent emission of a signal from multiple threads is not currently
 * supported.
 *
 * Currently, slots must have an associated ::context. This is used to ensure
 * that the slot is not executed after its required resources are destroyed.
 * Users should ensure that the associated ::context is destroyed before any
 * resources required by the slot are destroyed.
