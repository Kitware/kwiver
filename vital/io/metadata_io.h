/// The purpose of this function is to provide a standard way to get a base
/// file
/// name (no file extension) from metadata.  The caller of this function should
/// append a file extenstion and can then use this file to store data relevant
/// to the source frame.
///
/// The generated base file name is determined as follows.  If a source image
/// file name is provided in \c md then the basename (file extension removed)
/// of the image is returned. Otherwise, if a source video file name is
/// provided
/// the video file basename is appended with the frame number and returned.
/// If no source file name is provided, the base name is "frame" with the frame
/// number appended.
